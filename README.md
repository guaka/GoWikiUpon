The world needs this. I can't do it. Please someone make a living out of it.
People need to either stop believing anything they read on the webs (and that goes the way of their beliefs), either stop doubting it (if it goes against). Most of the content on the web is retarded clickbait that authors will write anything they believe you'll click on, regardless of whether it is true or not. Most of us know, or feel that. We don't know whether to believe anything we find on the webs, except maybe a handful of sources that we trust.
We don't know who to trust.
It doesn't have to be that way.
What the world needs is a public database of trustworthyness. As soon as an article becomes popular enough, *someone* will perform some factchecking on it. This person needs to have a place to go make the conclusions they came to available to the public. Wikipedia style, where more than one contributor can refine each other's analysis.
Then, we need browser extention that check the page you're viewing against that database, and tells you what factcheckers have found out about it.
It's just an idea. Make it your own.
